/**
 * Tests the [LockFreeSlidingTimeWindowMetrics] class using the Lincheck framework.
 *
 * Since Lincheck does not account for time, we need to manually and quickly advance the time to ensure
 * the test validates the sliding behavior of the time window (i.e., sliding the window every second).
 * We achieve this by using a static timer that advances the time every 10 ms by a value between 1s and 1.25s
 *
 * It is important to note that the windowSize must be large enough to prevent records from being discarded.
 * This is because the sequential version may run faster or slower than the concurrent version,
 * leading to different results and potential test failures, even if there is no bug in the implementation.
 * This can be verified by commenting out the line where metrics are discarded, which should make the test pass.
 * The required window size depends on the machine's speed, so slower machines may need a larger size.
 *
 * The model checking test is ignored because it is extremely slow (~3m) and is most useful during development. Also,
 * to run it you need to disable the Jacoco plugin, as it seems to interfere with the model checking test.
 *
 * In contrast, stress testing is faster and can catch rare bugs that require many context switches,
 * making it suitable for regular builds.
