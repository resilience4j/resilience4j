= resilience4j-spring-boot3

This add-on gives simple to use and highly configurable Spring Boot 3 starter.
With this starter you can apply rate limiters and circuit breakers to any of your beans by using annotations and configuration files.

NOTE: For detailed documentation look at our *https://resilience4j.readme.io/docs/getting-started-3[Usage Guide]*

[WARNING]
====
**Important Note on Aspect Order**

In Spring Boot 3, the default Aspect Order may cause `@Retry` to run *before* (outside) `@CircuitBreaker`. This means a single logical operation with multiple retries will be recorded as **multiple failures** by the CircuitBreaker, potentially opening the circuit too aggressively.

To ensure the CircuitBreaker wraps the entire Retry operation (recording only 1 failure per total attempt), explicitly configure the aspect order so that the CircuitBreaker has a higher priority (lower value):

[source,properties]
----
# Ensure CircuitBreaker runs first (Outer)
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.circuitBreakerAspectOrder=1
# Ensure Retry runs second (Inner)
resilience4j.retry.retryAspectOrder=2
